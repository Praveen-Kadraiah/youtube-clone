# youtube-clone
 I created a YouTube page solely using HTML and CSS, incorporating various interactive features such as tooltips, animations, and dynamic content.  I embedded my personalized Spotify playlist, allowing visitors to enjoy my favorite songs while exploring the content on the page.

the above shows the project display made using 
1. grid
2. flexbox
3. tooltips
4. adding hyper-links
5. media-queries

NOTE: this web-page is not responsive enough to access in Android/ios.
